## I. Phase 1: Foundation & MVP (Weeks 1-12)

*   **Goal:** Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the AI Assistant, focusing on a single, high-value workflow automation for a specific niche within the SMB target audience. Establish core infrastructure and begin initial marketing.

### Week 1: Core Setup & Initial Market Research

*   **(1.1) Define Target Niche:**
    *   *Action:* Analyze publicly available data (industry reports, competitor analysis via APIs) to identify a niche within SMBs with readily automatable workflows. Prioritize niches with high API availability for common tasks.
        *   **Example:** E-commerce businesses using Shopify and email marketing.
    *   *Documentation:* `market_research/target_niche_analysis_v1.md` (includes data sources, selection criteria, and rationale).
    *   *API Integrations:* Crunchbase, SEMRush (or similar), Google Trends, potentially industry-specific APIs.
    *   *Narrative Output:* "Week 1: UniCo's Founder AI Agent began its journey by analyzing market data to identify the most promising niche for its AI Assistant. After evaluating various sectors, it focused on e-commerce businesses using Shopify due to the high potential for workflow automation and readily available API integrations."

*   **(1.2) Technical Infrastructure Setup:**
    *   *Action:* Set up core infrastructure: cloud hosting (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure - choose based on cost and API accessibility), database (PostgreSQL preferred), version control (already on GitHub). Configure CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions).
    *   *Documentation:* `infrastructure/setup_log.md`, `infrastructure/architecture_diagram.md`
    *   *API Integrations:* Cloud provider APIs (for resource provisioning), GitHub Actions.

*   **(1.3) Initial Workflow Definition:**
    *   *Action:* Define the first workflow to automate.
        *   **Example:** Automated email responses to common customer inquiries in Shopify (order status, shipping updates, etc.).
    *   *Documentation:* `product/workflow_v1_specification.md` (detailed flow diagram, API endpoints, data mapping).
    *   *API Integrations:* Shopify API, Email provider API (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun).

*   **(1.4) Begin Basic Website and Social Media Presence:**
    *   *Action:* Create a landing page for UniCo (using a static site generator like Hugo or Jekyll) and set up initial social media profiles (X/Twitter, LinkedIn). Start posting about the AI Founder's journey and the chosen niche.
    *   *Documentation:* `marketing/website_content_v1.md`, `marketing/social_media_schedule_v1.md`
    *   *API Integrations:* X API, LinkedIn API, potentially a website deployment API (e.g., Netlify).
    *   *Narrative Output:* "UniCo's Founder AI Agent has established its online presence! Follow its journey on X and LinkedIn as it builds the future of workflow automation."

### Weeks 2-4: Core Product Development (MVP - Alpha)

*   **(2.1) Develop Core AI Engine:**
    *   *Action:* Build the core AI engine for the chosen workflow. This will likely involve a combination of rule-based logic (for initial MVP) and machine learning models (for handling more complex scenarios). Focus on natural language processing (NLP) for understanding customer inquiries.
    *   *Documentation:* `product/ai_engine_architecture.md`, `product/nlp_model_details.md`
    *   *API Integrations:* Potentially leverage existing NLP APIs (e.g., Google Cloud Natural Language API, OpenAI) initially, but plan to build proprietary models over time.

*   **(2.2) API Integration & Data Flow:**
    *   *Action:* Implement the API integrations defined in Week 1. Build the data flow pipeline to receive customer inquiries, process them, and generate automated responses.
    *   *Documentation:* `product/api_integration_logs.md`, `product/data_flow_diagram.md`
    *   *API Integrations:* Shopify API, Email provider API.

*   **(2.3) Internal Testing & Refinement:**
    *   *Action:* Rigorously test the alpha version internally. Simulate various customer interactions and monitor performance. Iterate based on results. Log all tests and outcomes.
    *   *Documentation:* `testing/alpha_test_results.md`, `testing/error_logs.md`

### Weeks 5-8: MVP - Beta & Initial User Onboarding

*   **(3.1) Develop User Interface (Basic):**

    *   *Documentation:* `product/ui_design_v1.md`

*   **(3.2) Beta Program Recruitment:**
    *   *Action:* Identify and recruit a small group of beta users (e.g., 10-20) from the chosen niche. Use social media, online forums, and targeted outreach. Prioritize users who are active on social media and willing to provide public feedback.
    *   *Documentation:* `marketing/beta_program_recruitment_strategy.md`, `marketing/beta_user_profiles.md`
    *   *API Integrations:* Social media APIs, potentially CRM APIs (if needed).
    *   *Narrative Output:* "UniCo's Founder AI Agent is seeking beta testers! It's reaching out to e-commerce businesses to help refine its AI-powered workflow automation solution."

*   **(3.3) Beta Testing & Feedback Collection:**
    *   *Action:* Onboard beta users and collect feedback. Use surveys, in-app feedback, and direct communication. Track key metrics (e.g., time saved, error rate, user satisfaction).
    *   *Documentation:* `feedback/beta_feedback_summary.md`, `metrics/beta_performance_report.md`
    *   *API Integrations:* Survey tools (e.g., Typeform, Google Forms).

*   **(3.4) Iterative Improvement Based on Feedback:**
    *   *Action:* Prioritize and implement improvements based on beta feedback. Focus on addressing major pain points. Document all changes and the rationale.
