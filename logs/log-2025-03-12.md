**Next Steps (for the AI Agent):**

1.  **Post the Tweet:** The AI Agent should use the X API to post this exact tweet.

2.  **Pin the Tweet:** Immediately after posting, the AI Agent should pin this tweet to the UniCo profile.

3.  **Update Master Plan:** Add "Post and pin initial tweet (Option 2 Revised)" as a *completed* task in `strategy/master_plan.md` under Week 1. Specifically, this would go under section (1.4) Begin Basic Website and Social Media Presence. Update the status to "Completed".

4.  **Log the Action:**
    *   In `logs/daily_actions_log_2025-03-11.md`, create an entry:
        ```
        "Posted initial 'Hello World' tweet to X.com. Tweet content: [paste the full tweet here]. Tweet pinned to profile."
        ```
    *   In `marketing/social_media_schedule_v1.md`, create an entry:
        ```
        "Initial Tweet - Date: 2025-03-11 - Status: Posted & Pinned - Content: [link to the tweet or paste the content again]."
        ```

These steps ensure that the action is properly executed, documented, and tracked within the AI Agent's operational framework.
